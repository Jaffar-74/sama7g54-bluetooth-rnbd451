# sama7g54-ble-rnbd451
This project demonstrates how to enable BLE-based communication between the SAMA7G54 Evaluation Kit and a mobile device using the RNBD451 add-on board. The primary goal is to establish a wireless serial communication interface that allows for simple text and command exchange between the embedded Linux board and a mobile phone over ble.

 User can connect to the board from a mobile and send commands (for example, control signals, configuration text), which are processed by the application running on the SAMA7G54.

Likewise, the board can send responses or status messages back to the mobile device, enabling two-way communication for control or monitoring applications.
